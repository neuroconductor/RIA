<p>Radiomics Image Analysis (RIA) package was developed to facilitate radiomic analysis of medical images. <code>RIA</code> can calculate hundreds of different statistics on both 2D and 3D images. <code>RIA</code> supports analysis of <code>DICOM</code>, <code>NIfTI</code> and <code>nrrd</code> images. Almost all calculations are vectorized and therefore are super-efficient. The package is developed by Márton Kolossváry a medical doctor not an engineer, therefore all functionalities of the software package are developed in a way that can be learnt by non-professionals. <code>RIA</code> is constantly updated with new functionalities and wrap-around functions to make the calculation of radiomic metrics even simpler.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to understand all the details of each function and just wish to start calculating right away, please read the chapter “Converting medical images images to RIA_image” and then jump right to “One click solution to calculate all radiomic statistics”.</p>
<p>First, lest simply load <code>RIA</code></p>

<p>#Converting medical images to RIA_image Medical images can be converted to RIA_image class using the <em>load_dicom</em>, <em>load_nifti</em> and the <em>load_nrrd</em> functions. All you have to do is give the location of the file or files as a string. Current examples are given for <em>load_dicom</em>, however <em>load_nifti</em> and <em>load_nrrd</em> work the same, but please be aware of subtle differences explained in help of these functions and in specific sections of the user manual!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/load_dicom.html">load_dicom</a></span><span class="op">(</span>filename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"C:/DICOM/"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>load_dicom</em> does several things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Converts DICOM files to RIA_image class using the <em>readDICOM</em> function of the <em>oro.dicom</em> package. If <em>load_nifti</em> is used the image loading is done by the <em>readNIfTI</em> function of the <em>oro.nifti</em> package, while the function <em>read.nrrd</em> is used from the <em>nat</em> package in case <em>load_nrrd</em> is used.</p></li>
<li><p>If <strong>mask_filename</strong> is provided, then the image is filtered one of two ways. If the <strong>mask_filename</strong> is the same as the <strong>filename</strong>, then the values in <strong>keep_mask_values</strong> indicate which voxels values to keep in the original image. This way the image can be segmented for a specific subset of voxels with given intensities. For example, if you would wish to only analyze low-density non-calcified voxels, you could set the <strong>keep_mask_values</strong> to <strong>-100:30</strong>. If a different folder is given to <strong>mask_filename</strong>, then <em>RIA</em> loads the mask image which needs to be the same image type as the original image. Using the <strong>keep_mask_values</strong>, you can select which values you consider to indicate which voxels to keep. By convention, the default is 1. However, multiple values may be given, which is convenient in cases when several regions of interest are provided in the mask image. Furthermore, some software after image manipulation reverse the order of the images in the Z axis, and therefore they need to be changed back. In this case <strong>switch_z</strong> needs to be set <em>TRUE</em>. Whenever using mask images to identify voxels to be analyzed, please always make sure, that the orientation of the mask image and of the original image is the same!</p></li>
<li>
<p>The 2D or 3D image is croped to the smallest bounding box still containing the whole image. It is useful to minimize the size of the image to save memory. The <strong>zero_value</strong> supplied to the <em>load_dicom</em>, <em>load_nifti</em> or <em>load_nrrd</em> function is used to identify voxels not containing any data. If it is not supplied, then the smallest value present in the dataset is considered as indicating voxels without any data. If for some reason it is important that the RIA_image be the same size (same x,y,z dimensions) as the original supplied image, then this functionality can be turn off by:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/load_dicom.html">load_dicom</a></span><span class="op">(</span>filename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"C:/DICOM/"</span>, crop_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the smallest values which indicate no data, are changed to <em>NA</em> for further calculations. If wished to be turned of, then use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/load_dicom.html">load_dicom</a></span><span class="op">(</span>filename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"C:/DICOM/"</span>, replace_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since some DICOM images do not store negative values, rather store all values as non-negative integers, shifting of the values is needed. The desired smallest value is set by the <strong>min_to</strong> input. If not specified then by default it is set to <em>-1024</em>. Please check for all data whether shifting is needed! If shifting of the values is not needed then use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/load_dicom.html">load_dicom</a></span><span class="op">(</span>filename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"C:/DICOM/"</span>, center_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By default <strong>center_in</strong> is set to <em>FALSE</em> for <em>load_nifti</em> and <em>load_nrrd</em>, since these images are often preprocessed and therefore contain the proper values for analysis. But please be aware, that in all cases, the load images should be inspected to see in the values are reasonable, for example if the minimum and maximum values are in the range that would be expected!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, <em>load_dicom</em>, <em>load_nifti</em> or <em>load_nrrd</em> adds basic information regarding the original image and ran processes into the <em>header</em> (if available) and <em>log</em> slot of <em>RIA_image</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All above mentioned settings can be combined as wished to achieve proper conversion of the DICOM image. Furthermore, all parameters of the <em>readDICOM</em>, <em>readNIfTI</em> and <em>read.nrrd</em> function of the <em>oro.dicom</em> <em>oro.nifti</em> and <em>nat</em> packages can be set in the <em>load_dicom</em>, <em>load_nifti</em> and <em>load_nrrd</em> functions.</p>
<p>As a result the <em>RIA_image</em> object will have three slots:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>RIA_image$data</code> which contains the original image as a 2D or 3D numerical array in <code>RIA_image$data$orig</code>, and a modified image in <code>RIA_image$data$modif</code> that has been created using one of the functions. Only one original and one modified image are stored in the <code>RIA_image$data</code> slot. However, several modified images can be saved to new slots as we will see later.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code>RIA_image$header</code> which contains basic information regarding the loaded image. These entries are populated from the DICOM header of the image. Elements can be added or removed from the predefined set of DICOM_codes:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>RIA_image$log</code> which contains information regarding the original image and ran processes on the <em>RIA_image</em>. The log is constantly updated by the functions, and some functions use it for inputs. <em>load_dicom</em>, <em>load_nifti</em> and <em>load_nrrd</em> adds the following to the log if possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$events</code> is a vector containing the ran processes.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$orig_dim</code> is a vector containing the original dimensions of the DICOM image.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$directory</code> is a string containing the location of the DICOM images.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$logic_x</code> is a vector with a length of the original x dimension. Ones indicate slices which contained data and zeros which did not in the x dimension. Same is true for <code>DICOM$log$logic_y</code> and <code>DICOM$log$logic_z</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$zero_value</code> is a number indicating the value that was considered to indicate no data</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$changed_to</code> is the value to which voxel considered not to have any data were transferred to.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$shift</code> the value that was added to all voxel values to achieve proper values.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$orig_vol_mm</code> the volume of the original image. The volume is calculated by calculating how many voxels contain data and multiplying it by x,y and z length of the voxels.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$orig_surf_mm</code> the surface of the original image. The surface is calculated by assessing which sides of the voxels do not have any neighbors and then summing all of these surfaces which are calculated from the lengths of the sides of the voxels.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$surface_volume_r</code> the value of the surface to volume ratio of the original image.</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$orig_xy_dim</code> the length of each voxel in the x and the y planes. This is also called the in-plane resolution</li>
<li>
<code>DICOM$log$orig_z_dim</code> the length of each voxel in the z plane. This is also called the cross-plane resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we will see, functions can add new elements to the log and also add new slots to the <em>RIA_image</em>. If the loading was successful, we will be notified by <code>RIA</code> in the console. All messages may be suppressed by setting the <strong>verbose_in</strong> parameter to <em>FALSE</em>.</p>
<p>With the package two preloaded datasets are given:</p>
<ul>
<li>NRS: the DICOM images of a segmented plaque showing the napkin-ring sign</li>
<li>Non_NRS: the DICOM images of a segmented plaque without the napkin-ring sign</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using the NRS dataset for all following examples. Load the data using:</p>

<p>#Discretization of voxel values Discretization of voxel values is crucial for radiomic analysis. Since many metrics rely on the spatial relationship of different voxel values, we need to decrease the number of possible values. This is needed since we do not want to consider for example a voxel value of 456 any different from 457, since the difference is probably attributable to noise and does not hold any information regarding spatial heterogeneity. Discretization is done using the <em>discretize</em> function. It receives a <em>RIA_image</em> and outputs a RIA_image with a new slot <code>RIA_image$discretized</code> containing the images with discretized values.</p>
<p>Discretization is effected by two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of bins to which the values will be transformed to</li>
<li>the length of each bin</li>
</ul>
<p>##Specifing the number of bins The number of bins can be easily specified using the <strong>bins_in</strong> parameter.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/discretize.html">discretize</a></span><span class="op">(</span>RIA_data_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">DICOM</span>, bins_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 2 NUMBER OF EQUALLY SIZED BINS</span></code></pre></div>
<p>##Specifing the length of each bin There are two main types of discretizations. We either have equally sized or equally probable bins. Equally sized bins mean that the range between the minimum and the maximum value is divided into a predefined number of bins of which all have the same lengths. For example is our smallest value is 0 and the largest is 100 and we wish to discretize into 4 equally sized bins then the cut points will be at 25, 50 and 75, result in 4 bins each with a length of 25 units. However if the discretization is done using equally probable bins then the length of each bin might be different, but the number of elements in it are the same. This might result is cut points such as: 10, 35 and 55 for example in case of a rightly skewed dataset. The type of discretization is defined by the <strong>equal_prob</strong> parameter. The default is <em>FALSE</em>, therefore by default images are dichtomized using equal sized bins. Setting it to <em>TRUE</em> will result in equally probable bins:</p>

<p>The discretize function updates the log of the <em>RIA_image</em> by adding the discretization to the events:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">log</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">events</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "Created"                   "Cropped"                  </span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [3] "Changed_to_NA"             "Shifted_by_-1024"         </span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [5] "Discretized_equal_sized_2" "Discretized_equal_prob_2"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It also adds the cut points that were used for the discretization:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">log</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">cuts_es_2</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 65</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The names of the created images and corresponding elements in the <em>log</em> can be changed as we will see later. But for convenience <code>RIA</code> automatically names the new images. If not crucial for some reason, I would suggest to stick with the automatically predefined names.</p>
<p>##Additional input parameters of discretize function</p>
<p>-<em>use_orig</em> whether to use the original image (which might be croped etc.) stored in <code>RIA_image$data$orig</code> or to use the modified image stored in <code>RIA_image$data$modif</code>. By default it is set to <em>TRUE</em>. Only in very special cases might one want to discretize an image that has already been discretized or modified by an other function.</p>
<p>-<em>write_orig</em> whether to overwrite the original image stored in <code>RIA_image$data$orig</code>. Usually it is not advised to overwrite the master image since then only modified images can be further processed. Therefore, by default it is set to <em>FALSE</em></p>
<p>-<em>verbose_in</em> whether write information regarding the running processes in the console.</p>
<p>##Batch discretization Since the number of bins and the type of discretization can significantly effect our later results, usually several discretizations are performed on a image to receive many different images. Using <code>RIA</code> it is very easy to perform several different discretizations with just one line of code. For example if you wish to discretize your image to 4, 8, 16 and 32 equally sized bins, all you have to do is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/discretize.html">discretize</a></span><span class="op">(</span>RIA_data_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">DICOM</span>, bins_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">4</span>,<span class="fl">8</span>,<span class="fl">16</span>,<span class="fl">32</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 4 NUMBER OF EQUALLY SIZED BINS</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 8 NUMBER OF EQUALLY SIZED BINS</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 16 NUMBER OF EQUALLY SIZED BINS</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 32 NUMBER OF EQUALLY SIZED BINS</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or more easily if you want 4, 8, 16 and 32 equally probable bins:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/discretize.html">discretize</a></span><span class="op">(</span>RIA_data_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">DICOM</span>, bins_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">5</span><span class="op">)</span>, equal_prob <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 4 NUMBER OF EQUAL PROBABILITY BINS</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 8 NUMBER OF EQUAL PROBABILITY BINS</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 16 NUMBER OF EQUAL PROBABILITY BINS</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; SUCCESSFULLY DISCRETIZED DATA INTO 32 NUMBER OF EQUAL PROBABILITY BINS</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These resulted in our image discretized in 2,4,8,16,32 equally probable and equally sized bins, which are stored in the <code>$discretized</code> slot of the <em>RIA_image</em>:</p>

<p>#First-order statistics First-order statistics are derived from the distribution of values and therefore discard all spatial information. Many of these metrics are commonly known (mean, median), however several metrics describing the heterogeneity of the values might be less known (energy, entropy). <code>RIA</code> can calculate 44 different first-order statistics using the <em>first_order</em> function. As with all statistical measures, it is saved in a separate slot of the <em>RIA_image</em>, and the name of the slot starts with <em>stat_</em> and since first-order, end with <em>fo</em>, resulting in the slot name of <em>stat_fo</em>. A detailed list and explanation of each statistic can be found in the supplementary material of: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233836" class="external-link">Márton Kolossváry et al. </a></p>
<p>By default, <em>first_order</em> calculates statistics on the image present in <code>RIA_image$data$orig</code>.</p>

<p>#Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) calculations and statistics The function <em>glcm</em> calculates GLCM matrices of 2D and 3D images. GLCMs are second-order statistics, meaning that statistics are calculated from the spatial relationship of two voxel values and not from the values themselves. GLCM are square matrices, where there are as many rows and columns as there are different voxel values. The values in the i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup> column represents the probability of finding a <em>j</em> value voxel next to a <em>i</em> value voxel in a given direction and distance. Therefore, for a given image several different GLCM matrices may be calculated, depending on the <em>direction</em> and the <em>distance</em>. In <code>RIA</code> <em>direction</em> and <em>distance</em> is determined by three integer parameters specifying where the examined voxel is compared to the index voxel.</p>
<ul>
<li>off_right: how many voxels to look to the right (x coordinate)</li>
<li>off_down: how many voxels to look downwards (y coordinate)</li>
<li>off_z: how many voxels to look to in the cross-plane direction (z coordinate). This parameter is only used if the image is 3D</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: to calculate the GLCM matrix of the last modified image stored in <code>RIA_image$data$modif</code>, in the direction of right: 1; down: 2; z-plane: 2; you just have to write:</p>

<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 32 32</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As discussed in the first-order case, the image wished to be analyzed may be set using the <strong>use_orig</strong>, <strong>use_slot</strong> and <strong>save_name</strong> parameters. <code>RIA</code> looks at the name of the provided image, if numbers are present in it, the it will set the dimensions and the resulting name of the GLCM based-on these values. If no numbers are present, then it will use the automatic name generator of <code>RIA</code> to figure out the name of the last image manipulation. If it does not succeed, then it will calculate how many different gray levels there are in the image to set the dimensions of the GLCM matrix and the name of the statistic. However, it might occur for example that the data was discretized to 32 equally sized bins, and then one of the bins does not contain any data. In these cases the GLCM will only be 31 x 31!</p>
<p>##Additional input parameters of glcm function Tow further parameters may be set to change the output of the function:</p>
<ul>
<li>symmetric: If TRUE, then the transpose of the initial GLCM matrix will be added to itself, which is the same as calculating the GLCM in the opposite direction. Doing so creates a symmetric GLCM matrix, which holds information regarding not only one direction, but also of the opposite direction as well, since asking how many times a <em>j</em> value voxel occurs next to a <em>i</em> value voxel in a given direction is the same as asking how many times a <em>i</em> value voxel occurs next to a <em>j</em> value one in the opposite direction. With this strategy, if you wish to calculate the GLCMs in all directions of space, then you only have to actually calculate half of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default <em>glcm_all</em> uses a distance of 1 to calculate the matrices in all directions. Using the <strong>distance</strong> parameter this can be set to any specific positive integer. A value of 2 would mean <code>RIA</code> looks not at the voxels right next to each other, but at one with one voxel between them to calculate the GLCM matrices. However <code>RIA</code> only looks in directions equivalent to the directions to the distance = 1 case, intermediate voxels are currently not supported in cases of bigger distances.</p>

<p>##Statistics on GLCM matrices The main purpose of calculating GLCMs, is to derive statistics from them. GLCM statistics can be calculated using the <em>glcm_stat</em> function. Overall, <code>RIA</code> can calculate 240 different GLCM statistics of which some contain more than one value. A detailed list and explanation of each statistic can be found in the supplementary material of: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233836" class="external-link">Márton Kolossváry et al. </a></p>
<p>As previous functions, <em>glcm_stat</em> can process single or multiple GLCMs For single data processing, one can use the <strong>use_slot</strong> parameter to calculate GLCM statistics on a specific GLCM</p>

<span class="co">#&gt; GLCM STATISTICS WAS SUCCESSFULLY ADDED TO 'ep_2_122' SLOT OF RIA_image$stat_glcm</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The results as all statistical calculations, are saved to a “stat_” slot of the <code>RIA_image</code>, specifically to the <code>RIA_image$stat_glcm</code> slot. The name is automatically generated based on the supplied GLCM name. However it may be changed by the <strong>save_name</strong> input if desired.</p>
<p>###Batch calculation of GLCM statistics The <em>glcm_stat</em> function also support batch calculations. Therefore, if you wish to calculate statistics for all calculated GLCMs the you can achieve this by one line of code:</p>

<p>The names of the outputs can also be specified. Be aware of providing the same amount of names as there are GLCMs being processed. Failing to do so will throw an error.</p>
<p>##Statistics on GLCM matrices in all directions The main purpose of calculating all these statistics in all directions is to somehow aggregate them into one rotationally invariant statistic. This is achieved by using some kind of function to sum up these values. Conventionally the average is taken. Using <em>glcm_stat_all</em>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb33"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/glcm_stat_all.html">glcm_stat_all</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">DICOM</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function used to calculate the aggregated statistic can be set using the <strong>statistic</strong> parameter. The supplied string must contain a “X”, which will be replaced with the array of the GLCM statistics value. Further attributes of the function may also be given. For example, if you wish to calculate the median of all GLCMs calculated in different directions, then it must be supplied as: <em>“median(X, na.rm = TRUE)”</em>. These batch functions only work with automatically calculated and named images and statistics using previously mentioned batch functions!</p>
<p>#Gray level run length matrix (GLRLM) calculations and statistics The function <em>glrlm</em> calculates GLRLM matrices of 2D and 3D images. GLRLM are higher-order statistics, meaning that statistics are calculated from the spatial relationship of more than two voxel values. GLRLM are matrices, where the number of rows equals the number of gray levels, while the number of columns equals the length of the longest run. <em>Run length</em> is defined as the number of voxels occurring next to each other with same values in a given direction. The i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup> column of the GLRLM represents how many times it occurs in the image, that <em>i</em> value voxels are next to each other <em>j</em> times. Therefore, for a given image several different GLRLM matrices may be calculated, depending on the <em>direction</em>. In <code>RIA</code> <em>direction</em> is determined by three integer parameters specifying the direction as a vector in co-ordinate space. There is no distance parameter, since we want to calculate how many same value voxels occur next to each other in that direction. Therefore the three inputs are logicals not integers.</p>
<ul>
<li>off_right: positive values indicate to look to the right, negative values indicate to look to the left, while 0 indicates no offset in the X plane</li>
<li>off_down: positive values indicate to look to the right, negative values indicate to look to the left, while 0 indicates no offset in the Y plane</li>
<li>off_z: positive values indicate to look to the right, negative values indicate to look to the left, while 0 indicates no offset in the Z plane</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: to calculate the GLRLM matrix of the last modified image stored in <code>RIA_image$data$modif</code>, in the direction of right: 1; down: 0; z-plane: 1; you just have to write:</p>

<p>As discussed in the first-order case, the image wished to be analyzed may be set using the <strong>use_orig</strong>, <strong>use_slot</strong> and <strong>save_name</strong> parameters. <code>RIA</code> looks at the name of the provided image, if numbers are present in it, the it will set the dimensions and the resulting name of the GLRLM based-on these values. If no numbers are present, then it will use the automatic name generator of <code>RIA</code> to figure out the name of the last image manipulation. If it does not succeed, then it will calculate how many different gray levels there are in the image to set the dimensions of GLRLM matrix and the name of the statistic. However, it might occur for example that the data was discretized to 32 equally sized bins, and then one of the bins does not contain any data. In these cases the GLRLM will only be 31 x max(run length)!</p>
<p>##Batch calculation of GLRLM The <em>glrlm</em> function also support batch calculations on discretized images. Therefore, if you wish to calculate a given GLRLM for all discretizations all you have to do is:</p>

<p>##Statistics on GLRLM matrices The main purpose of calculating GLRLMs, is to derive statistics from them. GLRLM statistics can be calculated using the <em>glrlm_stat</em> function. Overall, <code>RIA</code> can calculate 11 different GLRLM statistics. As previous functions, <em>glrlm_stat</em> can process single and multiple GLRLMs at once. For single data processing, one can use the <strong>use_slot</strong> parameter to calculate GLRLM statistics on a specific GLRLM</p>

<span class="co">#&gt; GLRLM STATISTICS WAS SUCCESSFULLY ADDED TO 'ep_2_101' SLOT OF RIA_image$stat_glrlm</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The results as all statistical calculations, are saved to a “stat_” slot of the <code>RIA_image</code>, specifically to the <code>RIA_image$stat_glrlm</code> slot. The name is automatically generated based on the supplied GLRLM name. However it may be changed by the <strong>save_name</strong> input if desired.</p>
<p>###Batch calculation of GLRLM statistics The <em>glrlm_stat</em> function also support batch calculations. Therefore, if you wish to calculate statistics for all calculated GLRLMs the you can achieve this by one line of code:</p>

<p>##Statistics on GLRLM matrices in all directions The main purpose of calculating all these statistics in all directions is to somehow aggregate them into one rotationally invariant statistic. This is achieved by using some kind of function to sum up these values. Conventionally the average is taken. Using <em>glrlm_stat_all</em>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/glrlm_stat_all.html">glrlm_stat_all</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">DICOM</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function used to calculate the aggregated statistic can be set using the <strong>statistic</strong> parameter. The supplied string must contain a “X”, which will be replaced with the array of the GLRLM statistics value. Further attributes of the function may also be given. For example, if you wish to calculate the median of all GLCMs calculated in different directions, then it must be supplied as: <em>“median(X, na.rm = TRUE)”</em>. These batch functions only work with automatically calculated and named images and statistics using previously mentioned batch functions!</p>
<p>#Geometry-based statistics Several statistics have been derived to evaluate different geometrical properties of objects. <code>RIA</code> calculates 9 conventional geometrical parameters and 3 fractal dimensions. Geometrical statistics can be calculated both on the original image:</p>

<p>and also on discretized images. Similarly as previous functions, if the desired image is stored in <code>RIA_image$data$modif</code>, then by setting the <strong>use_orig</strong> parameter to <strong>FALSE</strong> the function will run on the modified image. Using the <strong>use_slot</strong> parameter a specific image can also be set. The output is automatically named, but can be changed using the <strong>save_name</strong> parameter. The main reason to run geometry-based statistics on discretized images is to evaluate the geometrical features of the different sub-components. To calculate statistics on all sub-components of an image the <strong>calc_sub</strong> parameter has to be set to <strong>TRUE</strong>, which is the default:</p>

<p>##Additional input parameters of geometry function Further inputs can be specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>xy_dim: a numeric value of the length of a voxel in the x or y plane, if it is not provided, then <code>RIA</code> uses the values present in the <code>RIA_image$log$orig_xy_dim</code>.</li>
<li>z_dim: a numeric value of the length of a voxel in the z plane, if it is not provided, then <code>RIA</code> uses the values present in the <code>RIA_image$log$orig_z_dim</code>.</li>
<li>all_vol: overall volume of the image, if it is not provided, then <code>RIA</code> uses the values present in the <code>RIA_image$log$orig_vol_mm</code>.</li>
<li>all_surf: overall volume of the image, if it is not provided, then <code>RIA</code> uses the values present in the <code>RIA_image$log$orig_surf_mm</code>.</li>
<li>calc_dist: logical indicating whether to calculate the maximum distance between the voxels. Calculations may take significant time.</li>
</ul>
<p>###Batch calculation of geometry-based statistics The <em>geometry</em> function also support batch calculations. Therefore, if you wish to calculate statistics for all discretizations, then all you have to do is:</p>

<p>#One click solution to calculate all radiomic statistics Previous chapters showed each detail of the RIA package. However, many researchers just wish to calculate radiomic features without having to know exactly what is going on and do not wish to fine tune all functions by themselves. The <em>radiomics_all</em> function does all the work. With a simple line of code, you can calculate all the desired parameters without any hassle. After loading the radiological images to <code>RIA</code> format, just type the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">DICOM</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/radiomics_all.html">radiomics_all</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">DICOM</span>, equal_prob <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span>, bins_in <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">2</span>,<span class="fl">8</span>,<span class="fl">32</span>,<span class="fl">128</span><span class="op">)</span>, distance <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">3</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This simple line of code discretizes the image into 2, 8, 32 and 128 equally sized bins and calculates first-order statistics, GLCM based statistics averaged in all directions for distances 1, 2 and 3, GLRLM based statistics averaged in all directions and geometry based statistics on the original image. If you wish to calculate first-order statistics or geometry based statistics on discretized images as well, you can specify this by setting <strong>fo_discretized</strong> and <strong>geometry_discretized</strong> to <em>TRUE</em>.</p>
<p>In the next section learn how to export all you calculated statistics just using one line of code.</p>
<p>#Export of radiomic statistics All saved radiomic metrics in the <code>RIA_image</code> can be conveniently saved using the <em>save_RIA</em> function. All you have to do is supply the folder where you wish to export the results to using the <strong>save_to</strong> parameter You may also set the name of the exported files using the <strong>save_name</strong> parameter. A grouping label specifying which class the case belongs to can also be set using the <strong>group_name</strong> parameter. A last but not least, you need to set which slots of statistics you wish to export, if you wish to export all of them, then set the <strong>stats</strong> as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/save_RIA.html">save_RIA</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">DICOM</span>, save_to <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"C:/Test/"</span>, save_name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"My_first_radiomics"</span>, group_name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Case"</span>, stats <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"stat_fo"</span>, <span class="st">"stat_glcm_mean"</span>,  <span class="st">"stat_glrlm_mean"</span>, <span class="st">"stat_geometry"</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And that’s it! There you have your first radiomics analysis!</p>
<p>#Conclsions <code>RIA</code> package for R is a fast, versatile and user-friendly way to calculate radiomic statistics on <em>DICOM</em>, <em>NIfTI</em> and <em>nrrd</em> images using only a few lines of code. One can calculate several hundreds of different statistics on various versions of an image. If you wish to better understand Radiomics, please read: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346329" class="external-link">“Cardiac Computed Tomography Radiomics: A Comprehensive Review on Radiomic Techniques”</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233836" class="external-link">“Radiomic Features Are Superior to Conventional Quantitative Computed Tomographic Metrics to Identify Coronary Plaques With Napkin-Ring Sign”</a> which describes the calculation and each statistic in detail in the supplementary files.</p>
